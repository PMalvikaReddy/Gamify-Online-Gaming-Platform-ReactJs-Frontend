# NFT Minting using Mantle and Scroll Zk-EVM payment contract.

This project consists of two smart contracts one among them is NFT Minting  contract deployed on Mantle testnet, and a L2(Layer 2) payment contract deployed on Scroll Zk-EVM.

- ### Scroll -
    The most important aspect of the project is purchasing games. This is done by leveraging a contract deployed on SCROLL's Zk-EVM. This         contract runs on L-2 and hence can help when the project needs to be scaled, i.e when more users are onboarded and there is a need to         satisfy the requests of each user.

- ### Mantle -
    The NFTs are minted using a contract deployed on MANTLE. These NFTs are specific for a game. They are available in different rarities ("Common", "Rare", "Super Rare") and act as in game items or collectibles. For Example:- Gun skins, characters/avatars, swords etc.
    Once a game is bought by the user, they can obtain new collectibles by minting NFTs using the MANTLE contract.
